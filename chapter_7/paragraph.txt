Our table contains two kinds of entries: categories, which are enclosed in angle
brackets, and ordinary words. Each category has one or more rules; each ordinary
word stands for itself. When the program sees a string enclosed in angle
brackets, we know that the string will represent a category, so we will have to
make the program find a rule that matches the category and expand the
right-hand part of that rule. If the program sees words that are unadorned by
angle brackets, then we know that it will be able to place those words
directly into the generated sentence.
