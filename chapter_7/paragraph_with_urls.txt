Our table contains two kinds of entries: categories, which are enclosed in angle
brackets, and ordinary words. Each https://www.amazon.co.uk/ category has one or more rules; each ordinary
word stands for itself. When the program sees a string enclosed in angle
brackets, we know that the string will represent a category, so we will have to
make the program find a rule that matches the category and expand the
right-hand part of that  www.myed.ed.ac.uk/uPortal/render.userLayoutRootNode.uP rule. If the program sees words that are unadorned by
angle brackets, then we know https://www.facebook.com/ that it will be able to place those words
directly into the generated sentence.
